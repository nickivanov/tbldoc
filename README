1. What's in this archive
--------------------------

This archive contains a bunch of SQL scripts, XSD and XSL files, and a sample 
CSS style sheet that all serve a single purpose: to create simple documents 
describing tables and views in a database. 

The information that is extracted from a database system catalog contains 
description of each column of each (specified) table and view. That inormation
is saved as an XML document that conforms to the provided schema. An XSL 
transformation can then be applied to that XML in order to produce an HTML
representation of the catalog data. 

Internet Explorer and Firefox can perform  transformation of XML documents "on 
the fly", so opening XML file in one of those browsers presents a nicely 
formatted database catalog. A sample style sheet (CSS) is provided to format the 
HTML.

The HTML file can be viewed online, copied and pasted into a word processing 
program, or opened directly by such program (e.g. Microsoft Word).  

Database system catalog contents differ from vendor to vendor and from 
version to version. For this reason the SQL query used to extract catalog
information is also different in each case. 

List of files in this archive:

	README			- this file;
	tbldoc.xsd		- XML schema definition
	tbldoc.xsl		- XSL transformation template
	tbldoc_db2v8.sql	- database catalog extraction script for 
				  DB2 UDB v8
	sample.xml		- sample database catalog, as extracted by the 	
			  script
	tbldoc.css		- sample style sheet for the HTML presentation


2. How to use this stuff
------------------------

Extract the files into a directory.

You will need to edit the SQL script to make it extract the data you need. By 
default all tables and views that are not in SYS% schemas will be selected.

Connect to the database and run the extraction script, redirecting its output to 
a file. For example:

	db2 -xtf tbldoc_db2v8.sql -r catalog.xml

Open catalog.xml in Internet Explorer or Firefox (other browsers may work to; I 
didn't test it though).

3. Notes
--------

At this time only one extraction script is available: for DB2 UDB v8. I may come 
up with versions for other DBMS's one day writing your own script should be 
relatively easy.
